# Logo Files

Place your Rabrix logo files here:

- `rabrix-logo-black.png` - Logo for light backgrounds (header, light sections)
- `rabrix-logo-white.png` - Logo for dark backgrounds (optional, for dark sections)

**Recommended specifications:**
- Format: PNG with transparency
- Size: 48x48px to 96x96px (or higher resolution for retina displays)
- The header will automatically handle missing logos gracefully

The header component looks for `rabrix-logo-black.png` by default.
