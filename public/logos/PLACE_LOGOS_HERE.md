# Logo Files Location

Please place your Rabrix logo files in this directory (`/public/logos/`):

## Required Files:

1. **rabrix-logo-black.png** - Logo for light backgrounds (header, light sections)
   - Recommended size: 48x48px to 96x96px (or higher for retina)
   - Format: PNG with transparency
   - This is the main logo used in the header

## Optional Files:

2. **rabrix-logo-white.png** - Logo for dark backgrounds (if you have dark sections)
   - Same specifications as above

## Banner Files:

If you have banner images, you can place them here as well:
- `banner-hero.png` or `banner-hero.jpg`
- `banner-feature.png` or `banner-feature.jpg`

The header component will automatically detect and use `rabrix-logo-black.png` when it's available.

Once you place the logo file, the 404 errors will stop and the logo will appear in the header.
